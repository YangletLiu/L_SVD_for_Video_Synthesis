# L_SVD_for_Video_Synthesis
We provide 4 tensor completion algorithms to synthesize a video frames:

1.HaLRTC, run HaLRTC_example.m file to get the results.
2.NCPC, run NCPC_example.m file to get the results.
3.TNN-ADMM, run TNN_ADMM_example.m file to get the results.
4.Tubal_Alt_Min, run Tubal_example.m file to get the results.

Algorithm 3 and 4 are used to verify the main theorem in our paper, 1 and 2 are contrast experiments.
